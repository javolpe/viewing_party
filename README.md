# Viewing Party

This is the base repo for the [viewing party project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing party is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for the user and friend's.  The app does not yet
have capability to stream movies so it is more for the purpose of setting a calendar event, with specific movie details, to help coordinate a joined viewing 
experience.
